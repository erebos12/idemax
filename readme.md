# Idemax â€“ For Maximal Idempotency! ðŸš€

**IdeMax** (Idempotency Key Service) manages idempotency keys in **Redis** to detect and prevent duplicate API requests.  

## **Functionality**  
- **Create** an idempotency key with status and expiration time.  
- **Retrieve** a stored key with status, HTTP status, and response data.  
- **Delete** a key to free up storage.  
- **Error handling** for missing or non-existent keys and tenants.  

## **Use Case**  
The service ensures that repeated API requests (e.g., due to network failures or duplicate user actions) are not processed multiple times. Ideal for **payments, order processing, or external API integrations**. ðŸš€
